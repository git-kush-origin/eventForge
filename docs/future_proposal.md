# Future Development Proposals

## 1. Direct Message Analysis
- Implement DM conversation tracking
- Analyze 1:1 interactions and response patterns
- Priority scoring for DM threads
- Integration with existing thread analyzer

## 2. Channel-Specific Analysis
- Configure channel groups by topics (e.g., AI, Engineering, Product)
- Listen to all messages in specified channels
- Topic-based importance calculation
- Automated insights generation
  - Trending discussions
  - Key announcements
  - Technical debates
  - Knowledge sharing

## Implementation Priority
1. Direct Message Analysis
   - More personal, immediate impact
   - Simpler scope
   - Builds on existing thread analysis

2. Channel-Specific Analysis
   - Broader scope
   - Requires topic modeling
   - More complex filtering and categorization

## Required Scopes
- `im:history` - For DM access
- `im:read` - For DM listing
- Additional channel scopes as needed

## Next Steps
1. Start with DM implementation
2. Develop topic classification system
3. Extend to channel groups
4. Add customizable monitoring rules
